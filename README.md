# CGPA Calculator

## Overview
This CGPA Calculator is a Streamlit web application developed to help students of KPR Institute Of Engineering And Technology and other Anna University affiliated colleges calculate their Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) easily. The application follows the grading system prescribed by Anna University regulations.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this application arose from the necessity to provide students with a convenient tool to calculate their SGPA and CGPA accurately. Often, students faced challenges in finding online resources that precisely adhered to Anna University's grading system. Therefore, this application aims to fill that gap and provide an intuitive and user-friendly solution.

## Development Process
Initially, a Java-based solution was developed to address the same problem. However, to make the tool more accessible and user-friendly, it was decided to create a Python-based web application using Streamlit. Leveraging ChatGPT's API, the original Java code was adapted into a Python script, and additional features were implemented, such as allowing users to select their letter grade from a dropdown menu.

## Features
- Input the number of semesters and subjects for each semester
- Select letter grades from a dropdown menu
- Automatically calculate SGPA and CGPA
- Provides a user-friendly interface for quick and easy calculation

## Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the application by executing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
3. Access the application in your browser at the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage
1. Select the number of semesters.
2. For each semester, input the number of subjects and select the corresponding letter grade for each subject.
3. Click the "Calculate CGPA" button to compute the SGPA for each semester and the overall CGPA.
